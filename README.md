## 📘 **About the Project**
This project explores global Covid-19 data using SQL to understand infection patterns, mortality rates, vaccination progress, and health risk factors across countries.  
It demonstrates analytical SQL skills through real-world style questions and advanced transformations.

---

## 📁 **Dataset**
The data comes from **Our World in Data (OWID)**, which includes:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **covid_deaths** | Daily cases, deaths, population, deaths per million, continent |
| **covid_vaccinations** | Vaccinations per day, fully vaccinated %, health-related factors |

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**
The analysis aims to answer:

- What % of the population was infected in each country?  
- What countries and continents had the highest death count?  
- What was the global mortality rate?  
- How did vaccination progress in each region?  
- Can we build a Health Risk Index using normalized factors?  
- How long did it take each country to reach 50% full vaccination?
